# Build-OpenSSL-cURL

Script to build OpenSSL, nghttp2 and libcurl for OS X, iOS and tvOS with Bitcode enabled for iOS, tvOS.  Includes patching for tvOS to not use fork() and adds HTTP2 support with nghttp2. 

## Build
The `build.sh` script calls the three build scripts below (openssl, nghttp and curl) which pull down the specified release version.  Versions are specified in the `build.sh` script:

	########################################
	# EDIT this section to Select Versions #
	########################################

	OPENSSL="1.0.1t"
	LIBCURL="7.50.1"
	NGHTTP2="1.14.0"

	######################################## 

## OpenSSL
The `openssl-build.sh` script creates separate bitcode enabled target libraries for:
* Mac - x86-64
* iOS - iPhone (armv7, armv7s, arm64) and iPhoneSimulator (i386, x86-64)
* tvOS - AppleTVOS (arm64) and AppleTVSimulator (x86-64)

The tvOS build has fork() disable as the AppleTV tvOS does not support fork(). 
Edit `openssl-build.sh` to change the version of OpenSSL that will be downloaded and built.

	|____lib
	   |____libcrypto.a
	   |____libssl.a

## HTTP2 / nghttp2
The `nghttp2-build.sh` script builds the nghttp2 libraries used by libcurl for the HTTP2 protocol.
* Mac - x86-64
* iOS - armv7, armv7s, arm64 and iPhoneSimulator (i386, x86-64)
* tvOS - arm64 and AppleTVSimulator (x86-64)

Edit `nghttp2-build.sh` to change the version of OpenSSL that will be downloaded and built.  Include the relevant library into your project. The pkg-config tool is required.  The build script tests for this and will attempt to install if it is missing.   Rename the file to libnghttp2.a:

	|____lib
	   |____libnghttp2_iOS.a
	   |____libnghttp2_Mac.a
	   |____libnghttp2_tvOS.a

DISABLE HTTP2: The nghttp2 build can be disabled by using `build.sh --disable-http2`

## cURL / libcurl
The `libcurl-build.sh` script create separate bitcode enabled targets libraries for:
* Mac - x86-64
* iOS - armv7, armv7s, arm64 and iPhoneSimulator (i386, x86-64)
* tvOS - arm64 and AppleTVSimulator (x86-64)

The curl build uses `--with-ssl` pointing to the above OpenSSL builds and `--with-nghttp2` pointing to the above nghttp2 builds..
Edit `libcurl-build.sh` to change the version of cURL that will be downloaded and built.

	|____lib
	   |____libcurl_iOS.a
	   |____libcurl_Mac.a
	   |____libcurl_tvOS.a


## Xcode

Xcode7.1b or later is required for the tvOS SDK.

To include the OpenSSL and libcurl libraries in your Xcode projects, import the appropriate libraries for your project from:
* Curl - curl/lib [rename to libcurl.a]
* OpenSSL - openssl/Mac/lib, openssl/iOS/lib, openssl/tvOS/lib
* nghttp2 (HTTP2) - nghttp2/lib [rename to libnghttp2.a]

Usage
=====

 1. Edit and Run `build.sh` 
 2. Libraries are created in curl/lib, openssl/*/lib, nghttp2/lib
 3. Copy libs and headers to your project.
 4. Import appropriate "libssl.a", "libcrypto.a", "libcurl.a", "libnghttp2.a".
 5. Reference Headers, "Headers/openssl", "Headers/curl".
 6. Specifying the flag  "-lz" in "Other Linker Flags" (OTHER_LDFLAGS) setting in the "Linking" section in the Build settings of the target.
 7. To use cURL, see below:

        #include <curl/curl.h>

        - (void)foo {    
            CURL* cURL = curl_easy_init();  
            ...  
        }

NOTE: For iOS project with 64 bit targets, you will need to edit the `curlbuild.h` header if you get an error simliar to this: `'curl_rule_01' declared as an array with a negative size`

curlbuild.h

	/* The size of `long', as computed by sizeof. */
	// ADD Condition for 64 Bit
	#ifdef __LP64__
	#define CURL_SIZEOF_LONG 8
	#else
	#define CURL_SIZEOF_LONG 4
	#endif

You may also need to edit this section:

	/* Signed integral data type used for curl_off_t. */
	//#define CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_OFF_T long
	//ADD Condition for 64 Bit
	#define CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_OFF_T int64_t

`curl/curlbuild-ios-universal.h` is a universal example, tested on iOS platforms, made out of libcurl-7.50.3. You'd better check the diff between this file and `curlbuild.h` before using it.

Example Apps
============

Example Xcode project "iOS Test App" is located in the examples folder.  This project builds an iPhone Objective C App using libcurl, openssl, and nghttp2 libraries. The app provides a simple single text field interface for URL input and produces a curl respone.

## Archive

The `build.sh` script will create an ./archive folder and store all the *.a libraries built along with a MacOS binary for `curl` and `openssl`.

## Build Troubleshooting Tips

The AppleTVOS curl build may fail due to a macports "ar" program being picked up (it was in the path - You will see a log message about /opt/local/bin/ar failing in the curl log). A quick cleanup of the path (so that the build uses /usr/bin/ar) fixed the problem.  - Thanks to Preston Jennings (prestonj) for this tip.
